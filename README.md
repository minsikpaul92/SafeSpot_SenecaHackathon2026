## 🧩 The Problem

In June 2021, a heat dome killed [570 people in British Columbia](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-heat-dome-sudden-deaths-570-1.6122316). Many victims lived near cooling centres — but had no way of knowing. Climate impacts like heatwaves disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, and there's no simple way to see where climate risk and limited shelter access overlap.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

SafeSpot Toronto deploys a **Raspberry Pi temperature sensor in a high-risk heat island zone**, cross-checks live sensor readings against urban heat island data, and guides users to the nearest safe space when conditions become dangerous.

Unlike weather apps that report a city-wide average, SafeSpot measures the **actual temperature where you are**.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🍓 1. Real-Time Hardware Temperature

- Raspberry Pi sensor **physically deployed in a heat island zone**
- Captures actual ground-level temperature — not a city-wide average
- Sensor readings POSTed to Hono backend at regular intervals
- Frontend polls `GET /api/sensor-latest` every 5 seconds (near real-time)
- Source badge: distinguishes live sensor data (`sensor`) from test overrides (`override`)

### 🗺️ 2. Urban Heat Island Map

- Interactive Leaflet map with Toronto's urban heat island layer
- Colour-coded risk areas: 🔴 High / 🟠 Medium / 🟡 Low Heat Area
- Data from ArcGIS: *Impervious Surface and Urban Heat Island Effect in Toronto*
- Historical surface temperature averages (not real-time — this is where the Pi matters)

### 🔬 3. Heat Island Cross-Check

- User's GPS location is checked against the heat island GeoJSON polygons using **ray-casting point-in-polygon** (no external dependencies)
- `getCombinedRisk(zoneLevel, sensorTemp)` calculates actual risk:

  | Zone   | Sensor Temp | Risk Level         |
  | ------ | ----------- | ------------------ |
  | Any    | < 30°C      | Silent (no warning)|
  | HIGH   | 30–35°C     | ⚠️ Caution         |
  | HIGH   | 35–40°C     | 🚨 Danger          |
  | HIGH   | ≥ 40°C      | 🔴 Extreme         |
  | MEDIUM | 35–40°C     | ⚠️ Caution         |
  | MEDIUM | ≥ 40°C      | 🚨 Danger          |

- Risk card only appears at **caution or above** — no false warnings on safe-temperature days

### 🚨 4. Danger Threshold Alert

- Full-screen alert banner when sensor reads **35°C or above AND user is in a heat island zone**
- Web Audio API siren sound (extreme / danger / caution tones)
- Browser push notifications with `requireInteraction` for extreme alerts
- Alert levels: `safe` → `caution` → `danger` → `extreme`

### 📍 5. Nearest Safe Space Routing

- Browser GPS detects the user's current location
- Haversine formula calculates distance to all cooling centres and libraries
- Shows nearest cooling centre + nearest library with compass direction
- **Google Maps directions** link with one tap

NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_token
```

### Raspberry Pi Script

```python
import requests
import time

BACKEND_URL = "https://safespot-backend-bbn6.onrender.com"

while True:
    temp = read_sensor()  # DHT22 / DS18B20
    requests.post(f"{BACKEND_URL}/api/sensor-data", json={"temperature": temp})
    time.sleep(5)
```

## 🎬 Demo Scenario

1. Web app opens — Toronto map loads with **heat island risk areas**
2. Browser GPS detects user location — marked on map
3. App checks if user is inside a heat island polygon (**point-in-polygon**)
4. Temperature is raised above **35°C** (via Raspberry Pi sensor or simulation)
5. App cross-checks: heat island zone + dangerous temperature → **🚨 Danger alert fires**
6. Full-screen banner + siren sound + push notification
7. App displays: **"Nearest Cooling Centre: [Name], 0.3 km away → Get Directions"**

## 🔑 Why Raspberry Pi?

Weather APIs report a **city-wide average**. Urban heat islands mean a specific block can be **5–10°C hotter** than the official city temperature. SafeSpot deploys the Pi **inside a heat island zone** to measure the actual ground-level temperature — then cross-checks that reading against the historical heat map to calculate your real exposure risk.

> *"Official forecast: 28°C. Your heat island zone: 36°C. That difference can be life or death."*
